						Guys, I got married! ðŸŽ‰ So go ahead and congratulate me. ðŸ˜Š

				<p>
					Since I was a child I believed in traditional values and dreamed about having a family that cares about love, harmony, and respect to traditions.
				</p>
				<p>
					But most girls I met only wanted to have a successful career and be independent. That made it difficult to find the one and only girl who I could start a family with.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm not against women who have jobs but I needed the kind of girl who shared my belief in traditional values and wanted to become a real housewife.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I gave up on this dream would ever come true in real life, I registered on a dating website. At first I was sceptical about the whole idea but we live in a world of digital opportunities and since I work in IT myself I thought why not?
				</p>

					<h1>LOVENCITY</h1>
					<p>
						Is the best place to chat, make friends.

				</article>

				<p>
					So, I registered to <a href="#">Lovencity</a>, filled out my account and started looking for "the one and only".
				</p>
				<p>
					Then one day I found her page, Amina. Her smile and description were sincere and heart-warming.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only was she beautiful, she shared my views on family and life in general. We started instant messaging and I couldn't believe how quickly we got along despite it being online.
				</p>

				<img src="./img/img-2.jpg" alt="#" width="700" height="366">

				<p>
					Every message told me that I had found the one. We decided to meet in real life and our first date went smoothly, as if we had known each other all our lives. Amina was just as a I imagined, she was beautiful, fun, and ready to support me in everything.
				</p>
				<p>
					After some time I proposed to Amina and she said yes.
				</p>

				<img src="./img/img-3.jpg" alt="#" width="700" height="366">

				<p>
					We prepared for the wedding tediously and very carefully. Since Indian weddings are not just a ceremony but a real triumph of culture and traditions.
				</p>
				<p>
					We chose a day that fit according to our astrological calendar and our families discussed every detail together right down to the attire.
				</p>

				<img src="./img/img-4.jpg" alt="#" width="700" height="366">

				<p>
					The ceremony started with Ganesh Puja to have good luck bestowed. Then there was the Mehendi ceremony, Amina had beautiful designs painted on her hands and feet with henna.
				</p>

				<img src="./img/img-5.jpg" alt="#" width="700" height="366">

				<p>
					We took part in rituals and exhanged marriage garlands and prepared for the most important part, the Saptapadi ceremony, where we promised to love and support each other and took seven steps around the sacred fire.
				</p>

				<img src="./img/img-6.jpg" alt="#" width="700" height="366">

				<p>
					Our wedding was full of love and it made our families' dreams come true. We started a new chapter in our lives together, building a family based on tradition and mitual understanding.
				</p>

				<img src="./img/img-7.jpg" alt="#" width="700" height="366">

				<p>
					So guys, if you want to find the love of your life and you're tired of disappointments, I sincerely recommend you to try <a href="#">Lovencity</a>. I'm willing to bet that you will definitely find her there. ðŸŒŸ

							Guys, those who think that there are no good girls on a dating site, you are very mistaken. I for example have been registered there for a month now. I also failed to meet a nice guy in real life. But I really hope that I can do it online.
